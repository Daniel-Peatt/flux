03-06-25 : I added the post api on the backend for sending form data to the database. COMMIT
03-10-25 : I am having issues getting the create challenge form submitted to the database. something to do with 
    null value for user_id in the row. 
03-11-25 : I finish the form for creating a challenge and the information goes to the database, besides the task. 
    I also started to learn and work on JWT authentication. I believe if I impliment this now it will be less annoying 
    than adding it later on. COMMIT 
03-12-25 : I added password hashing on the POST to the database using bcrypt, I know need to un-hash the password for logining in, 
    and continue videos on YT about JWT. 
03-13-25 : I have added the login API that will compare the user info typed in to the info in the database, using bycrypt.compare.
03-14-25 : I added the creation of a token when the user logs in.
    I then added the Middleware to authenticate the token and ensure it is still valid. (This can be added to api calls to get the logged in users info)
    I created a get challenge api route that gets the user info based on a login token. 
    I need to find out how to set up the page routes to recieve the token information.
03-16-25 : I got the fetch call to the dashboard, and set up a grid / flex layout for the dashbaord. 
    I need to get the task be sent to the database once when the create challenge is made. DONE
    I need to parse the task to get them to show up separetly on a list. 
03-17-25 : Added pie chart to days reamining compomnent, and started to fix task list on dashbaord. 
03-18-25 : Got the task component to populate on the dashboard. -COMMIT
